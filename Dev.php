        Hello! I’m the developer behind this Pomodoro + Flashcard website. This platform was built from scratch 
        with the aim of creating a simple yet powerful tool for managing time and enhancing learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a developer, my focus was on keeping the interface intuitive, the performance smooth, and the 
        experience seamless across devices. I used technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend 
        logic (if applicable) to make the tools reliable and responsive.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is a personal endeavor and a learning journey for me, and I’m continuously looking for 
        ways to improve it. Your feedback, suggestions, or contributions are always welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for using the website, and I hope it helps you stay productive and learn effectively.
    </p>
